===============================================================================

This repository contains files for a RAZR hands-on workshop that took place in
December 2017 for the first time. Files include the slides of a short intro-
ductory presentation, a collection of exercises, and some supplementary files.
This repository does not contain RAZR itself. Please download it from

https://github.com/torbenwendt/razr/releases

and specify the path, to where you unzipped the RAZR package, in

./tutorial_addpath.m

Besides, for some of the exercises additional third-party software and/or
databases are required:

* The API for SOFA-formatted HRTF databases:
  https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/Software_and_APIs
  
* HRTF databases, e.g.:
  https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/Files

* AFC - The psychophysical-measurement package for MATLAB:
  www.aforcedchoice.com

Paths to these databases/packages have to be specified within RAZR, namely in
the file

razr_cfg_user.m

in RAZR's root directory. For details, please see the RAZR README and the
documentation of razr_cfg_user.m.

You can store your own MATLAB scripts for the tutorial under

./user_files
